# First-look-into-React-and-JS

# I tried an small exercise using React and NPM

I made this small program just to test my skills in JS and to get the feel for React.
What I was doing:
  Display my name with basic HTML
  Made a clickable button
  Alertbox that display my name backwards and make all the vowels capital letter.
